# Basic solution - using DISTINCT and WHERE clause (id must be consecutive)
SELECT
    DISTINCT t1.Num As ConsecutiveNums
FROM
    Logs t1,
    Logs t2,
    Logs t3
WHERE
    t1.Num = t2.Num
    AND t2.Num = t3.Num
    AND t1.id = t2.id-1
    AND t2.id = t3.id-1
;


# Advance solution - using ROW_NUMBER to create a newid. (original id can be non-consecutive.)
With newlog AS (
    SELECT 
        *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY Id) as newid
    FROM 
        Logs
    )

SELECT
    DISTINCT t1.Num As ConsecutiveNums
FROM
    newlog t1,
    newlog t2,
    newlog t3
WHERE
    t1.Num = t2.Num
    AND t2.Num = t3.Num
    AND t1.newid = t2.newid-1
    AND t2.newid = t3.newid-1
;
